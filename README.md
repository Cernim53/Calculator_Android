## How to Use

## Here's a guide on how to use the calculator:

- Calculator Mode: The calculator operates in BASIC mode, which means it can perform one operation at a time. You input the numbers and the operator to perform the desired calculation.
- Operations: The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). To perform an operation, follow the format: [number] [operator] [number]. For example, to add 5 and 3, you would enter 5 + 3.
- Clear Display: To clear the display and start a new calculation, you can press the "Clear" or "C" button. This will remove any previously entered numbers or operations.
- Decimals: The calculator supports decimal numbers. You can input decimal numbers by using the decimal point (.) symbol. For example, to enter 3.14, you would simply input 3.14.
- Negative Numbers: To input a negative number, you can use the negative sign (-) before the number. For example, to input -5, you would enter -5. Note that the negative sign should be placed before the number, not after.
- Brackets: The calculator's display may show brackets, but they do not function as expected. They are appended to the display for visual clarity but do not affect the calculation. The calculator performs calculations based on the order of operations without the need for explicit brackets.
- Decimal Key: Pressing the decimal point (.) key twice in a row will ignore the second decimal point. This is to prevent accidental input of multiple decimal points in a single number.
- Orientation: The calculator's layout is designed to work in both portrait and landscape orientations. It adapts to the screen size and orientation of your device.
Remember to input one operation at a time and follow the correct format for performing calculations.

## Future Goals
- Implement proper use case for brackets
- Implement FORMULA mode to allow display to show multiple operands and operations
